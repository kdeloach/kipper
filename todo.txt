HIGH
- Create SpawnStrategy for emitters (random, everyNTicks)
- Ship always accelerates towards mouse

MED
- Add collidesWithTeam() to bullet; SpaceMine should be destroyable while it is charging?
- Create enemy emitter
- Build new weapon upgrade graph screen / weapon balancing
- Level tool

LOW
- Add "set target" upgrade; Allow player to right click to set target, weapons will fire towards this point instead of the mouse when Rotate ability is equiped.
- Create plasma weapon (different cooldown mechanism)
- Always perform a bounding box test before using masks
- Only use stopX() and stopY() for lightningbolt collision detection
- Do a better job with mouse scaling methods
- OSP should be the main delegator of mouse & keyboard events to game entities
- Update mask tool to assign weapon attach point
- Create weapon graphics and fix weapon relative offsets
- Add error output pane to Particle tool
- Add graveyard logic back to particle emitter; Performance impact?
- Add translateX, translateY to emitter
- Weapon balancing
- Move bolt splinter() into move() to create an animated lightning effect
- Change foreground stars theta opposite of ship heading; How will this effect look?
- LaserBeam should support N number of points; Right now only the start and end points are used for collision so it's possible that small projectiles can pass through the middle. Consider adding at least one additional point in the middle.
- Update mask tool to work with entities that have no image (TriangleMan)
- Should bullet size be a negative aspect of the damage upgrade?
- Add parallelization to OSP and particle emitter update/collide methods
- Add "split" upgrade
